Collaborative Blockchain Design

Palladio is an industry-specific, Business Application Monitoring software; intended to interact with "Collaborative Blockchain Design" Contracts (CBDs). CBDs are intended for Architects who want to design better buildings, in less time, for less money. It also enables Associates to help Architects design buildings, while learning new software and improving their skills. 

Collaborative Blockchain Design require a new way of thinking about design in general. Rather than relying on one "genius" architect who works through a design process in a a series of linear steps, Palladio encourages Architects to hire many professionals at once; effectively linking creative efforts simultaneously, to achieve incremental solutions for byte-sized design challenges.

The emphasis with CBDs is placed on high volume. Coming up with thousands of ideas is quick, simple, and effective since Architects submit easy-to-complete Contracts on platform where a fleet of verified Associate Architects are eagerly waiting to get involved. 

The benefit to the Architect who uses Palladio, is access to an immense pool of verified design proffessionals. Those design professionals are eager, recent-graduates; accredited by the CACB and ready to help Licensed Architects design better buildings, faster.
